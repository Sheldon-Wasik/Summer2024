# Summer2024
This repo will host the project Alyssa will be working on, consisting of any notebooks, scripts, outputs, etc

### Getting Summer2024 for yourself


`git clone https://github.com/Sheldon-Wasik/Summer2024.git`


### Development

#### Github etiquette

Start from the main branch, which should be the most up-to-date:

`git fetch`

`git checkout main`

`git pull origin main`

Create a new branch named after an RFI algorithm you want to add

`git branch new-branch-name`

Make any edits/additions. When you want to commit and push to Github,

`git add .`

`git commit -m "commit message"`

`git push origin new-branch-name`

And when you want to add your code back to main, open a pull request on Github.
